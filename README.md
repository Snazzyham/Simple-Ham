# Simple-Ham
The theme to my website and blog, powered by ghost. Inspired by [Dan Eden's website](http://daneden.me) and based off of a ghost theme known as Spooky-slate.

The theme has since been heavily modified and customised, and the css updated with SCSS. 

You are free to clone this theme and use it as you'd like, as long as you use it with the intention of learning a little. 

I often change the colour of my website, therefore there will be another version of this theme up soon probably titled Simple-Ham-Dark. 

Why are you still reading this readme.
